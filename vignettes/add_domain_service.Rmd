<div class="alert alert-danger" <strong="">
Don't confuse a <b>Domain Service</b> with an <b>Application Service</b>. If you are looking for a component that enables a remote client to interact with your system, then you need an <b>Application Service</b>, not a <b>Domain Service</b>.
</div>
```
```{=html}
<div class="alert alert-warning" <strong="">
<b>Application Services</b> serve clients by orchestrating <b>Domain Services</b>. <b>Domain Services</b> are not aware and have no knowledge of any <b>Application Service</b>.
</div>
```
## Overview

-   Entities and Value Objects are often to fine-grained to provide a convenient
    access to the capabilities of the domain layer.

-   Domain Service is part of the domain model. That means it expresses
    Ubiquitous

    Language in its Bounded Context.

## What is a Domain Service?

## Characteristics of a good Domain **Service**

1.  The operation relates to a domain concept that is not a natural part of an
    Entity or Value Object.
2.  The interface is defined in terms of other elements of the domain model.
3.  The operation is stateless.

```{=html}
<div class="alert alert-danger" <strong="">
Make sure you need a service. Stripping away behaviors that belong to Entity overzealously, lead to Anemic Domain Model, where Entities comprise data but not behavior. This is similar to representing an Entity with only a `data.frame`.
</div>
```

## Unit of Work (UoW)

There are no complex layers here. At most this component runs a query against
the query store database and maybe serializes the query result into some format
for transport (maybe a DTO, but maybe not), if that's necessary. [@Vernon2013,
p. 141]

### UoW Abstract Base Class

-   Similar to [python abc module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/abc.html)

-   Has the following public methods:

    -   `new` i.e. initialize

    -   `commit` must be implemented

    -   `rollback` must be implemented

    -   `exit` i.e. finalize. This function which calls `rollback`

### UoW Implementations

#### UoW Database Implementing

-   **DBI**, **dbplyr**, **RSQLite**

#### UoW Data Structure Implementing

-   **R6DS**, mainly `R6DS::RDict`
