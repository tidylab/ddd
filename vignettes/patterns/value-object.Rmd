## Highlights

-   Calling a Value Object without any input arguments returns the Null Value
    Object, which is usually an empty data.frame with column names and classes.
-   Equating Value Objects is based on field-based implementation, rather than
    identity based implementation. That means, two records are equal if all
    their fields are equal.
-   Value Objects can receive other Value Objects.
-   Value Objects can receive one or a set of Entities.
