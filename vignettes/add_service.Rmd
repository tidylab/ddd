## Characteristics of a good **Service**

1.  The operation relates to a domain concept that is not a natural part of an
    Entity or Value Object
2.  The interface is defined in terms of other elements of the domain model
3.  The operation is stateless.

## Unit of Work (UoW)

There are no complex layers here. At most this component runs a query against
the query store database and maybe serializes the query result into some format
for transport (maybe a DTO, but maybe not), if that's necessary. [@Vernon2013,
p. 141]

### UoW Abstract Base Class

-   Similar to [python abc module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/abc.html)

-   Has the following public methods:

    -   `new` i.e. initialize

    -   `commit` must be implemented

    -   `rollback` must be implemented

    -   `exit` i.e. finalize. This function which calls `rollback`

### UoW Implementations

#### UoW Database Implementing

-   **DBI**, **dbplyr**, **RSQLite**

#### UoW Data Structure Implementing

-   **R6DS**, mainly `R6DS::RDict`
